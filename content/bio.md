I'm a researcher and professor in ecology at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/), in the [School of Biological, Earth, and Environmental Sciences](https://www.unsw.edu.au/science/our-schools/bees).  

My work explores how biodiversity responds to environmental change using cutting-edge quantitative tools. I'm always open to new taxa, new ideas, new people, and new collaborations.
