Ruby is an ecologist who loves using high-quality data and field experiments to find new ways of looking at and protecting the natural world. She is a recent PhD graduate from Macquarie University, where she explored the large-scale ecology and evolution of flowers and pollination. Building on previous work as an ecological consultant, Ruby is currently researching ways to conserve and restore Australian biodiversity through the transition to renewable energy, using novel techniques such as machine learning ecoacoustics.
