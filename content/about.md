I'm a researcher and professor in ecology at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) in the school of biological, earth, and environmental sciences.  

My work explores how biodiversity respond to environmental changes using cutting edge quantitative tools.  Always open to new taxa, new ideas, new people and new collaborations.  

All scientific publications are now collected by orcid and google scholar. 

R packages are now in the r-universe, with code in development on GitHub.    

Writing for a broader audience is on the conversation.  Observations of biodiversity across the world are found on the iNaturalist citizen science site.
